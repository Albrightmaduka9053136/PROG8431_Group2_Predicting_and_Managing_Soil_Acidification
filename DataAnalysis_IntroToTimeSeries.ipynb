    "##### Perceived issue\n",
    "Long-term use of ammonium-based nitrogen fertilizers is acidifying soils across Canada. Falling soil pH reduces nutrient availability, increases toxic metals, and lowers crop performance — forcing farmers (including on the Prairies) to apply lime and incur extra cost."

    "##### Use Case\n",
    "Build a data-driven system that predicts when and where fertilizer application will significantly lower soil pH and recommends optimized fertilizer type/amount and liming actions to maintain target pH and maximize yield while minimizing costs and inputs."

    "```Alternative hypothesis (H₁)```: Higher rates/frequencies of ammonium-based nitrogen fertilizer applications (or certain management practices) are associated with a statistically significant decline in soil pH and corresponding changes in crop yield."
